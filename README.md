# DXPR Builder Examples

**These examples are not meant for production. We are planning a complete 
implementation of [SDC](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/getting-single-directory-components-drupal-core) in DXPR Builder which will make the architecture 
demonstrated in these modules obsolete**

## Overview

This repository showcases methods for extending the DXPR Builder, a Drupal page
builder, with new drag-and-drop elements.

## Modules in this Repository

- **Simple Element Module**: Introduces basic custom elements into the DXPR
  Builder.

- **Dynamic Element Module**: Demonstrates adding a real-time updating dynamic
  element.

These modules are designed for clarity and ease of understanding, to enhance
developer capabilities in extending the DXPR Builder.

## How To Install The Modules

1. The Examples project installs like any other Drupal module. There is
   extensive documentation on how to do this on
   [Installing Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules).
2. Within Drupal, enable any Example sub-module you wish to explore in Admin
   menu > Extend.
3. Clear caches.
4. The features of the module should now be active in your Drupal site.

## Using the Examples

- **Enable the Modules**: Activate the desired modules through the Drupal admin
  interface.
- **Explore Functionality**: Observe how the elements integrate with the DXPR
  Builder.
- **Read the Code**: The modules are extensively commented to explain their
  functionality and API usage.

## Conclusion

This repository is designed to facilitate understanding of DXPR Builder
extension through hands-on examples. Explore each module to discover different
techniques and best practices in Drupal module development.
